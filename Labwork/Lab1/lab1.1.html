	<h1>Title of Article about having pets during Covid</h1>
	<h2>Author: Yadanar Theint</h2>
	<p> In my home country, Covid Pandemic was started in March,2021. Since before that, I was already had a cat called <strong><em>Gar Garr.</em></strong>
		Covid let us to be locked down in our homes for several months and graually we felt abit lonely and started to have a pet like cat, dog or parrot to relief our boring.
		After some time, I found one stray kitten which was found so poorly and I decided to carry her to my home and named <strong><em>Kook Kook.</em></strong>

	<ul>There are several benefits of having them with us.
		<li>Companionship</li>
		<li>Help to improve better mental health</li> 
		<li>joy and happiness.</li>
	</ul>
