	<h1>Title of Article about having pets during Covid</h1>
	<h2>Author: Yadanar Theint</h2>
	<p> In my home country, Covid Pandemic was started in March,2021. Since before that, I was already had a cat called <strong><em>Gar Garr.</em></strong>
		Covid let us to be locked down in our homes for several months and graually we felt abit lonely and started to have a pet like cat, dog or parrot to relief their boring.
		After some time, I found one stray kitten which was found so poorly and I decided to carry her to my home and named <strong><em>Kook Kook.</em></strong>
	</p>

	<ul>There are several benefits of having them with us.
		<li>Companionship</li>
		<li>Help to improve better mental health</li> 
		<li>joy and happiness.</li>
	</ul>

	<p> 
		With the increase in pet ownership the AMA are encouraging policy makers to consider the needs of companion animals and their owners when considering rental, 
		strata and body corporate regulations are well as accepting animals in public places and transport.
